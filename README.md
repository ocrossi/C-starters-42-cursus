# C-starters-42-cursus

This repository combines 4 projects of C language.

First the lib part includes basic C functions, get_next_line a function to read a file line per line, and ft_printf (printf function recoded)

The second part, `fillit` is a project of its own and can't be included in a library. 

You can refer to the readmes of the lib and fillit at the root of their directories to understand what's going on.
